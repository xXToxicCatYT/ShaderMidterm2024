Part 1
I decided to replicate this game scene in the 3D space as I think it would be better to see the shaders in a 3D space.

Part 2
I have added the toon shader to the player and the ramps because in the example of the game they are both cartoon styled.

Part 3
For Color Correction I have used Unity's Post Processing Package. I made a post processing volume and it colour grades the specific layer I want it to. I then applied a post processing layer to the camera so it changes the colour grading through the view.

I went for a dessert theme as that is how it is in the scene example. I picked a gold orange colour filter and went for a hot temperature with low tint. To obtain a warm dessert feel for the game.
