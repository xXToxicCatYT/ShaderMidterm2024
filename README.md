Part 1
I decided to replicate this game scene in the 3D space as I think it would be better to see the shaders in a 3D space.

Part 2
I have added the toon shader to the player, ground and the ramps because in the example scene they are all cartoon styled. The ramps are shadowed by flat colours.

Part 3
For Color Correction I have used Unity's Post Processing Package. I made a post processing volume and it colour grades the specific layer I want it to. I then applied a post processing layer to the camera so it changes the colour grading through the view.

I went for a dessert theme as that is how it is in the scene example. I picked a gold orange colour filter and went for a hot temperature with low tint. To obtain a warm dessert feel for the game.

Part 4
My choice was the hologram shader and I applied it onto the round looking coins shown from the example scene. It really differentiates from the whole toon shading theme and makes the coins look special and important.

The hologram shader is similar to the rim lighting shader. The difference is that it is transparent using the alpha.
